   <h1>COMMUNITY PERFORMANCE</h1>

<p class="para1" style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST. WE HAVE FILLED ALL THE REGISTRATION SLOTS FOR THE COMMUNITY PERFORMANCE, THE REGISTRATION FOR COMMUNITY PERFORMANCE 2019 IS NOW CLOSED. SEE YOU NEXT YEAR.</p>
    <p class="para1">The community performance is a way for children and adults to showcase not only their talent in front of friends and family but a way to bring the community together to celebrate the spirit of Diwali. This year we are looking for cultural performances - whether that be classical, semi-classical or folk. If you would like to do a bollywood number we only ask that it be directly related to diwali or another cultural theme. While we would like everyone to participate, the number of slots are limited - we will be trying to diversify the talent and represent all parts of India. Here are a few guidelines:</p>
 <div class="para1"><ul>

<li>All performances must have a Diwali or cultural theme.</li>
<li>All costumes, props, moves, etc must be appropriate for a cultural and family audience.</li>
<li>Total dance performance time must be no longer than 3 (THREE) minutes. Participants will be requested to exit the stage if the performance exceeds 3 minutes.</li>
<li>A minimum of 6 (SIX) performers per item.</li>
<li>Maximum participants up to 20 only.</li>
<li>Only one item will be allowed to perform from each group/dance school.</li>
<li>Any member from your group cannot be involved with any other performance at Diwali Mela that might conflict with this performance.</li>
<li>Participation is free of charge, and there is no registration fee. All participants below the age of 10 have free entry to the Community Performance. Participants above the age of 10 will be given tickets. Each group will be given only one ticket for the choreographer. No parking pass will be provided to any groups/choreographers.</li>
<li>Your performance can be presented in any form of dance or any sort of creativity in the spirit of Diwali.</li>
<li>Preference will be given to groups from cultural organizations and dance schools.</li>
<li>If your dance school has a franchise and has different locations within the DFW region, thenÂ <u>one group per location and maximum 2 groups per dance school will be allowed.</u></li>
