   <h1>Ramlila</h1>

<p class="para1">Ramlila is the main highlight of the DFWICS Diwali Mela. It has been an integral and very important part of Diwali Mela since it’s inception. In many states of India especially in North India, even today the tradition continues during the festive season of Dashera and Diwali where local troops come together and perform the story of Ramayan in the form of Ramlila.</p>

<p class="para1">Ramlila at Diwali Mela has continued that tradition for our children and the new generation, so that they can experience the same magic and appreciate our rich culture.</p>

<p class="para1">Our Ramlila is a musical drama and dance production, depicting Ramyana in a very unique format. Every year, local talents, artists,
actors, dance schools, dancers, costume makers, prop builders and audio, video, light and sound experts come together, not professionals, but just dedicated and passionate over 80 Ram Bhakts come together and work many months together to produce one of the best Ramlila. </p>

<p class="para1">Although not much can be changed from the Ramayan story in itself, we all know Raja Dashrath &amp; Ayodhya, the Ram Janam, Sita
Swayamwar, Rani Kakeyee’s vachan, Ram Sita Laxman going to 14 years of Vanvas, Ravan kidnapping Sita Mata, pavan sut Hanummanji visiting
Ashok Vatika and then ofcourse Ram Ravan yudh and the victory of good over evil.</p>

<p class="para1">But over the years Ramlila team has tried their level best to show the same story in many different ways, whether it is just victory of Dharm over Adharm, or showing the importance of women in Ramyana like Ahalya, Mandodari, Shabri or showing the grandeur of Ayodhya and Mithila, Or by highlighting the characters that may have been forgotten our unsung heroes like Kevat, Bharat and Jambavant.</p>

<p class="para1">The year 2017 we had Siri as our narrator and last year 2018 we added Kumbhkaran as a new actor along with the Star Wars characters as our narrators and story weavers. While this year, in 2019 we have Devo ke Dev Mahadev Himslf narrating the Ramlila to Sati Parvati along with his
Ganas and Shiv dances adding absolutely new twist to old tradition of Ramlila performace.</p>
