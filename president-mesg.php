 <h2>Message from President</h2>
<p class="form"><img src="images/satish-gupta.jpg"  height="110" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"/> Dear Friends,</p>
<p class="form">I am happy and excited on behalf of DFW Indian Cultural Society to invite you to the 14<sup>th</sup> Annual Diwali Mela being held on Saturday, November 2<sup>nd</sup> 2019 at the State Fair Park Cotton Bowl Stadium. We have been holding this event with remarkable success for the past thirteen years and going by our experience, we expect the current year to be a great success too with an expected turnout of approximately 60,000 Asians. Each year, The DFW ICS Diwali Mela crowns as the biggest cultural festival for the community in the DFW area.</p>
<p class="form">This year again we have decided to pack all the fun for children, youth, adults and seniors. From Ram Leela and Bollywood singer Mohit Chauhan to spectacular fireworks, kids slide, Cultural dances to mouthwatering Indian food, all packed in one of the biggest Carnival of its kind in America. In view of requests received from PETA.org the board has unanimously decided not to offer Elephant rides and will substitute this with additional kids play items. We bring all this to you at a very minimal cost to you.</p>
<p class="form">The large number of people the Carnival attracted in the past years is a testimony to its success. The number of attendees keeps growing and it presents an important platform for a quick reach to the Asian Community of Dallas Fort Worth and the nearby cities of Texas. We would like to thank all our Sponsors who support us in this huge task. The purpose of this message is to request you to come with your family and friends and make the event a grand success. Your participation will go a long way in promoting our culture to the kids and youths of our community and continue to give us the inspiration to work towards it greater success.</p>
